RESEARCH QUESTION 1: VOCABULARY EVOLUTION VS STABILITY
Analysis date: 2025-11-18 14:13:13

Question: Which research fields show stable vocabulary over time
          vs rapid evolution in terminology?

Methodology:
  - Divided timeline into 3 windows: early (1996-2005), mid (2006-2015), recent (2016-2024)
  - Calculated top-20 terms per cluster per time window
  - Measured Jaccard similarity between consecutive windows
  - Average stability = mean of pairwise similarities

INTERPRETATION
Stability Score Interpretation:
  > 0.7: Highly stable vocabulary (mature, well-established fields)
  0.5-0.7: Moderately stable (gradual evolution)
  0.3-0.5: Moderate evolution (terminology changing)
  < 0.3: Rapid evolution (emerging or fast-moving fields)

Path Comparison:
  Overall winner: 500D
  300d shows lower average stability
  500d better captures temporal vocabulary patterns
